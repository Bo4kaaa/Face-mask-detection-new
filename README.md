## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload an image and get instant prediction.  
- Lightweight and easy to run locally.  
- Displays probabilities for both classes (`Mask`, `No Mask`).  

---

## ðŸ§  Model

- Built with **TensorFlow / Keras**.  
- CNN with 4 convolutional layers: 32, 64 , 128 , 256 filters.  
- Includes **ReLU activation**, **Batch Normalization**, **MaxPooling**, and **Dropout**.  
- Final Dense layer with **Sigmoid** for binary classification.  
- Achieved ~96% accuracy on test data.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Trained on the **Kaggle Face Mask Dataset**.  
- Two classes:  
  - With Mask  
  - Without Mask
