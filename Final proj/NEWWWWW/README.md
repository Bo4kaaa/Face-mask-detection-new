# ðŸ˜· Face Mask Detection  

A simple deep learning app that detects whether a person is **wearing a mask** or **not wearing a mask**.  

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload an image and get instant prediction.  
- Use webcam for real-time mask detection.  
- Displays probabilities for both classes (`Mask`, `No Mask`).  
- Lightweight and easy to run locally.  

## ðŸ§  Model
- Built with **TensorFlow / Keras**.  
- CNN with 4 convolutional layers (32, 32, 64, 128).  
- Includes ReLU activation, Batch Normalization, MaxPooling, and Dropout.  
- Final Dense layer with Sigmoid for binary classification.  
- Achieved **~93% accuracy** on test data.  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Trained on the **Kaggle Face Mask Dataset**.  
- Two classes:  
  - `With Mask`  
  - `Without Mask`
